`pretalx` is a conference planning tool focused on providing the best
experience for organisers, speakers, reviewers, and attendees alike.  It
handles the submission process with a configurable Call for Participation, the
reviewing and selection of submissions, and the scheduling and release
handling. After the event, `pretalx` allows speakers to receive feedback,
upload their slides, and organisers to embed recordings.

Read our `feature list`_ in our main site to get a better idea of what
`pretalx` can do for you, but it typically involves everything you'll need to
curate submissions and contents for a conference with several tracks and
conference days.

You can host pretalx yourself, as detailed in our `administrator documentation`_,
or use our public instance at `pretalx.com`_.
